# TSDR-00

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context

Needed:
- middleware
- groupging routes
- middleware grouping
- $ wildcard feature
- route default to home
- route not found error as well?

## Decision

Use the standard library for routing.

There appears to be 3 ways to pass information between middleware / handlers:
- setting middleware as a method of a type (possibly a struct)
- context
  - good for globlal key value pairs. ie user id, session id, request id, etc.
- method parameter
  - breaks the (ResponseWriter, *Request) method call, but there are ways around that.
  - Going to avoid this pattern for now.

Will use the "http.MethodGet" etc constants. [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#pkg-constants)
This will allow the compiler to catch mistypes.

## Why / Notes
Since Go 1.22 (2024-FEB) added ServeMux, better routing, and path parameters the
standard library is recommended by the community for routing.
This is further supported by the fact that many routers are now abandoned.

## Consequences

Don't have support of other developers on framework. Don't get any of the other goodies the framework has baked in.
