# ADR-100
# TSDR-100

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context

There is no standard. We do want to be consistent throughout the API.

## Decision

- [Michael Bissell](https://www.michaelbissell.com/2d5a25c0-8d0c-11ed-b6fc-b5eee5a22130/API-Standards)
  - like this. Short and sweet.
- [Set the right tone (for error messages)](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/error-messages/set-tone)

## Why / Notes

As the API grows we will probably need to tighten standards. Start simple till we
know what we need.

TODO pageination, order by, field filters.

  - Some good info but a bit much.
