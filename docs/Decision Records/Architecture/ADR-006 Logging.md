# ADR-006 Logging

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context









How exactly to handle logging.

### How long to keep logs. EVALUATE



Podcast was recommending as little as 4 days (long weekend). 7 days, 14 days or 30 days. Don't need forever. Start small first. Only lengthen for business need.

----------

Needs to be turned on and off with out code changes (in prod) and limited to file /  function / client

Advice was to send all logs to standard out (standard error?) and then use a different tool to send standard out on to where ever to use logs. Research why that advice was given

## Not an Option
- [Awesome Go's List of Logging](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go?tab=readme-ov-file#logging)
  - Would add dependencies which wouldn't meet this project.
- [dozzle](https://github.com/amir20/dozzle)
  - monitors docker logs, maybe for next project
