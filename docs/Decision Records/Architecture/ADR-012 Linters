# ADR-012 Linters  

## Status

Accepted, Proposed, Deprecated or Superseded (list DR)

## Context

We want to turn on linters. Which ones?

All 3 linter stages turned on from book.

aaron does not like single line if else statements
they easily hide scope and lessen readability.
have to reedit later when maintaining anyway.
can these be linted out?
